# EditorConfig is awesome: http://EditorConfig.org

# Currently all properties and values are case-insensitive. They are lowercased
# when parsed. Generally, if a property is not specified, the editor settings
# will be used, i.e. EditorConfig takes no effect on that part.
#
# It is acceptable and often preferred to leave certain EditorConfig properties
# unspecified. For example, tab_width need not be specified unless it differs
# from the value of indent_size. Also, when indent_style is set to "tab", it may
# be desirable to leave indent_size unspecified so readers may view the file
# using their preferred indentation width. Additionally, if a property is not
# standardized in your project (end_of_line for example), it may be best to
# leave it blank.
#
# For any property, a value of "unset" is to remove the effect of that property,
# even if it has been set before. For example, add "indent_size = unset" to
# undefine indent_size property (and use editor default).

# root:
#       Special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside
#       of any sections. Set to "true" to stop .editorconfig files search on
#       current file.
root = true

# indent_style:
#       Set to "tab" or "space" to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.
# indent_size:
#       A whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation
#       level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to "tab",
#       the value of tab_width (if specified) will be used.
# tab_width:
#       A whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab
#       character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and doesn't usually
#       need to be specified.
